basic-js-app
============

This is a very basic JavaScript app that demonstrates the evolution of a simple app from a few lines to one that has models, views, CSS, JS libraries, templates, and eventually multiple files (not implemented).

The individual steps are tagged. Use `git checkout <tag-name>` to load a tagged step.

    $ git tag
    v1-base
    v2-form-tag
    v3-js-libraries
    v4-form-handler
    v5-add-todo-item
    v6-add-view
    v7-view-template
    v8-dom-template
